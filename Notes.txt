CS 334 - Final same project adjusted
I have to start thinking about a final for my other AI class.

Gradient Inversion Attacks:
This attack utilizes the gradients of the model to essentially change the inputs
rather than adjust the weights of the model to get the same output for an input.
> This recovers a random input value, why would it be useful?
I can't gaurantee it will return a value that is useful. (Starts with a random input
and adjusts it until it fits the output)

Transferability attacks:
Inputs found to fool one model can be used to fool another model with different
training and weights.
